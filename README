how to run:
uvicorn fast_api_server:app --host localhost --port 8000 --reload

bugs:

- Not able to control the rover in real time. Need to fix
  (Just tested. It will only show final position when you disconnect.
  Update so that it updates graphically every move)

- Change colors of the rover and mines to make it more visually appealing.
